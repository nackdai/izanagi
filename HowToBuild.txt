- Windows

You have to install VisualStudio2010 SP1.
You have to install DirectX SDK.(including DirectX 9.0c)
You have to install .NET Framework 4.

1. Open "Build" folder.
2. Run "BuildAll_<Configure>.bat".

- Android

1. Set path

$ export NDK_ROOT=<your ndk root path>
$ PATH=$PATH:$NDK_ROOT

[example]
$ export NDK_ROOT=/cygdrive/c/cygwin/home/var/android-ndk-r7
$ PATH=$PATH:$NDK_ROOT

2. Generate makefiles

$ cd ./Build
$ ./GenAndroidMk.sh

3. Build libraries.

$ cd ./Libs/project/android
$ make

4. Build samples.

$ cd ./Samples/projects/android
$ make

* I confirm only Render2D sample.
  So, you can run only below command.

$ ndk-build NDK_PROJECT_PATH=${PWD} NDK_APPLICATION_MK="./Application_SampleKit.mk"
$ ndk-build NDK_PROJECT_PATH=${PWD} NDK_APPLICATION_MK="./Application_Render2D.mk"

5. Open a project by Eclipse

Project path is "./Samples/Android".

6. Copy sample .so file and assets.

$ cp -r Samples/projects/armeabi Samples/Android/sample/libs
$ cp -r Samples/Render2D/data/* Samples/Android/assets/data

If you want to build assets, you have to build assets on Visual Studio.
I've copied asset files for Render2D to 'assets/data' directory in Android sample directory.

7. Build and run a sample.

- Linux

1. Build external libraries.

$ cd ./Build
$ ./BuildExternal.sh

2. Build libraries.

$ cd ./Libs/project/makefile
$ make

3. Build samples.

$ cd ./Samples/projects/makefile

* You can confirm only Render2D sample.
  So, you can run only below command.

$ make Debug_GLUT -f SampleKit.makefile
$ make Debug_GLUT -f Render2D.makefile

4. Run a sample.

Render2D sample needs img data.
Currently, there is no way to build img data on Linux.
So, you need to copy img data from Windows to Linux.

- Web

1. Generate makefiles

$ cd ./Build
$ ./GenWebMk.sh

2. Build libraries.

$ cd ./Libs/project/web

* I don't prepare a bat file to run all bat files.
  So, you need to run each bat files.

3. Build samples.

$ cd ./Samples/projects/web

* I don't prepare a bat file to run all bat files.
  So, you need to run each bat files.

* I confirm only Render2D sample.
  So, you can run only below command.

$ Web_Render2D.bat

4. Run a sample.

* I confirm only Render2D sample.
  So, you can run only Render2D sample.

Copy files.

$ copy Render2D.* ..\..\Web

Move directory.

$ cd ..\..\Web

Copy data files.

$ xcopy ..\Render2D\data .\

Launch Server.

$ LaunchServer.bat

Run browser and access below url.

http://localhost:8000/Render2D.html
