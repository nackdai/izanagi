MultipleStaticLibraries
-----------------------
The app uses two libraries which in turn rely on a function
from a third library.

All libraries are static libraries.

They are implicitly linked via dependencies, and the App is not
set to depend directly on Utility. Instead, it gets this indirectly
bcause HelloLib and WorldLib depend on it.
