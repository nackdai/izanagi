This solution has two external libraries: a Windows version and a Linux version.

It has a MakeItSo.config file that defines how to replace the Windows libraries
with the Linux version when we build the gcc version.

The config has project-specific settings for the 'App' project, and dummy config
for 'AllProjects'. This is to test that project-specific settings override solution
settings.
