Before getting started, make sure all
[prerequisites](@ref fplutil_prerequisites) are installed and configured.

# Components

   * [build_all_android][] is an all-in-one build script that allows you to
     build, install and run native (C/C++) Android apps from the command line.
     This is ideal for build automation, but can also be in a developerâ€™s
     compile/run loop.
   * [buildutil][] performs the configuration, build and archive steps
     of [Android][] and [Linux][] C/C++ applications using a suite of
     [Python][] modules.  This suite of modules can automate builds in a
     continuous integration environment.
   * [android_ndk_perf][] is a desktop tool that enables native (C/C++)
     developers to measure the CPU utilization of their applications on
     [Android][], guiding their optimization efforts.
   * [libfplutil][] enables C/C++ developers to write traditional applications
     (like [Hello World][]) using "main()" and "printf()" on [Android][].
