build_all_android    {#build_all_android}
=================

[build_all_android][] is an all-in-one build script that allows you to
build, install and run native (C/C++) Android apps from the command line.
This is ideal for build automation, but can also be in a developerâ€™s
compile/run loop.

In order to use this tool, all [prerequisites](@ref fplutil_prerequisites)
should be installed.

# Building Applications    {#build_all_android_build}

By default [build_all_android][] will build all Android projects under the
current working directory.  For example, from the command line, the following
will change into the [fplutil][] directory and build all Android projects:

~~~{.sh}
    cd fplutil
    ./bin/build_all_android -E dependencies
~~~

The application will place the build artifacts in the following locations:

   * APKs in `fplutil/apks`
   * Shared (.so) and Static (.a) libraries in `fplutil/libs`.

The following files are produced when building all Android targets in
[fplutil][]:

~~~~
    apks/example-release-unsigned.apk
    apks/tests-release-unsigned.apk
~~~~

# Signing Applications    {#build_all_android_sign}

In order to install a release APK on a device it must be signed.  By default
[build_all_android][] build but not sign release APKs.  The `-S` or
`--sign_apk` flag will enable signing of APKs.

For example, the following will build and sign all APKs with a temporary key:

~~~{.sh}
    cd fplutil
    ./bin/build_all_android -E dependencies -S
~~~

In a similar fashion to unsigned APKs, signed APKs are placed in the apks
directory.  Signed APK names do not end in `-unsigned.apk`.

~~~{.sh}
    apks/example-release-unsigned.apk
    apks/example.apk
    apks/tests-release-unsigned.apk
    apks/tests.apk
~~~

## Signing with Keys    {#build_all_android_sign_key}

The method described above generates a temporary key, which is used to sign
the application.  Using a temporary key is ok when debugging but should not be
used when distributing your application to consumers as the application's
certificate is used to validate it's origin and allow the application to be
safely upgraded in future.

Firstly, a key needs to be generated using [keytool][] which will be used
to sign the application in future.  The following generates a certificate
referenced by the name `my_alias` in the keystore file
`my-release-key.keystore` using the `RSA` algorithm with a lifetime of around
27.5 years (`10000` days).

~~~{.sh}
    $ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore \
              -alias my_alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
~~~

[keytool][] will prompt for additional information required to generate the
key and a password which is used to access the keystore file in future.

After saving the password supplied to [keytool][] in a file
(e.g `mysecretpassword_file.txt`), applications can be built and signed with
[build_all_android][]:

~~~{.sh}
    cd fplutil/examples/libfplutil_example
    ../../bin/build_all_android -S -k my-release-key.keystore \
                                -K my_alias
                                -P mysecretpassword_file.txt
~~~

The "Signing Your App Manually" section on [Signing Your Applications][]
describes in detail how to generate a private key using [keytool][] and sign
an application directly using jarsigner.

It is also possible to sign using a private / public key pair (pk8 / pem)
using the `--apk_keypk8` and `--apk_keypem` arguments of [build_all_android][].
For information on how to generate pk8 / pem files see
[How to Sign APK Zip Files][].

# Installing Applications    {#build_all_android_install}

Using the `-i` or `--apk_install` flag, [build_all_android][] can install
applications to one or more devices attached to a workstation.

For example, the following will build all Android applications in [fplutil][],
sign the APKs and install them to an attached device:

~~~{.sh}
    cd fplutil
    ./bin/build_all_android -E dependencies -S -i
~~~

# Running Applications    {#build_all_android_run}

[build_all_android][] will run applications on an attached Android device
when the `-r` or `--apk_run` flag is specified.

For example, the following will build all Android applications in [fplutil][],
sign the APKs, install them to an attached device and then execute them in
sequence:

~~~{.sh}
    cd fplutil
    ./bin/build_all_android -E dependencies -S -i -r
~~~

# Build Configuration    {#build_all_android_build_config}

By default [build_all_android][] will build all applications in `release`
mode.  It's possible to select the `debug` with the `-T` or `--ant_target`
flag.

For example, the following will build all [fplutil][] applications in debug
mode with no native (C/C++) symbols:

~~~{.sh}
    cd fplutil
    ./bin/build_all_android -E dependencies -T debug
~~~

In order to perform symbolic debugging of native (C/C++) components with
`ndk-gdb` `NDK_DEBUG=1` must be passed to `ndk-build`.  Arguments are passed to
`ndk-build` using the `-f` or `--make_flags` flag.

For example:

~~~{.sh}
    cd fplutil
    ./bin/build_all_android -E dependencies -T debug -f NDK_DEBUG=1
~~~

To force optimization in debug mode, set `NDK_DEBUG=0`.

~~~{.sh}
    cd fplutil
    ./bin/build_all_android -E dependencies -T debug -f NDK_DEBUG=0
~~~

# Cleaning Build Artifacts    {#build_all_android_clean}

Build artifacts can be cleaned using the `-c` or `--clean` flag.  For example:

~~~{.sh}
    ./bin/build_all_android -E dependencies -c
~~~

# Working with Multiple Devices    {#build_all_android_multiple_devices}

By default, [build_all_android][] will only install or run applications on
one connected device.  It's possible to select the set of devices using
`-d` followed by a list of device serial numbers or `@` which selects all
devices attached to the workstation.

For example, the following will build all Android applications in [fplutil][],
sign them, install and run them on all attached devices:

~~~{.sh}
    cd fplutil
    ./bin/build_all_android -E dependencies -S -i -r -d @
~~~
